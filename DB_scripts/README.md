This folder contains a set of scripts to create a DB. 

Based on the information of the article and having enough samples of each type, we will follow the instructions to execute scripts that will:

1. create the encripted and compressed versions of these files
2. create the different file sizes, spliting the files created in step 1.
3. clean the DB. 


Note that some information is hardcoded, so you will need to edit and check them to ensure that the work properly.
